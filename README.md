This is my portfolio for my Machine Learning assignments.

## Overview of ML

This assignment here covers my general understanding of machine learning at the beginning of the course.
You can see my write up on this topic [here.](Overview of ML.pdf)

## Portfolio Component 1: Data Exploration 

This assignment here covers how the R programming language has built in data exploration tools whereas other programming languages require you to code said data exploration tools manually. This assignment also goes over the uses of covariance and correlation. You can see my write up on this topic [here](CSMLComponent1.pdf) and the code for this assignment [here.](CSMLComp1.cpp)
